### Using GitHub Free Models as Inference
To leverage GitHub's free models for inference, you can integrate them into your Python applications. These models can be accessed via APIs and used for various tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, and more. Ensure you have the necessary API keys and permissions set up in your GitHub account.

### Database
For storing and managing data, you can use databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite. Python provides libraries like SQLAlchemy and Django ORM to interact with these databases efficiently. Ensure your database schema is well-designed to optimize performance and scalability.
